## Description
This repository is created for the resourcepack of Minecraft CTM Monument "Ragecraft IV: Underworld".
The current supported version is **1.1.0**。

## How to translate the Map
In this version of the Map, the original version and translated versions are seperated. You need to download a modified version of the Map containing translation json keys to get the translation.: [CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD]()

IMPORTANT！！！Your game progress in the original version CAN'T BE MIGRATED to the translation version！！！ because we use a modified version of the Map. **PLEASE OPEN THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT SAVE OR FOLDER！！！**

If you need to update the translation file, all you need to do is replace `\%AppData%\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\[1.20.1] Ragecraft IV - by heliceo & Suso - v<版本>\resources.zip` with a newer `resource.zip`.

The translation json keys will be included in the world save later as the Map creator updates the map. At that time, you can do the same step above to update the translation file without losing your game progress.
